<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm an ethiopian and am 36 years old. I have studied foreign languages,
  tourism and project management. Since 2010, I have been working as a teacher,
  tour guide, interpreter and administrative assistant. During the pandemic lock
  down, I gave much attention to codding and begun some free online courses
  which was not successful. Now, I have decided and determined to learn more,
  get the necessary skills and to change my profession as well.
